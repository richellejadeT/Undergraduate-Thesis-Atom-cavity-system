# Undergraduate-Thesis-Atom-cavity-system
Undergraduate thesis as part of my requirement for a BS in Applied Physics degree. 
We implement the Truncated Wigner Approximation in simulating the system to observe different phases of matter such as a time crystal. If you wish to learn more about my thesis, just send me a message.

Title: **Influence of harmonic confinement and contact interaction in an atom-cavity system**
Adviser: Dr. Jayson G. Cosme
Progress: **Completed** last 2nd Semester A. Y. 2021-2022
